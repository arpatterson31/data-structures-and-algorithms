# Trees

- **Binary Tree** - no more than 2 child nodes
- **Binary Search Tree** - everything on the left is lower than the parent, everything to the right is great than the parent

## Challenge

### Binary Tree

- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called `preOrder`, `inOrder`, and `postOrder` which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

### Binary Search Tree

- Define a method named `add` that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Define a method named `contains` that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
