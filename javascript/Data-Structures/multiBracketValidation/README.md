# Multi-Bracket Validation

## Challenge Description

- [Link to code](multi-bracket-validation.js)

- Create a function `multiBracketValidation(input)`

- Round Brackets : `()`
- Square Brackets : `[]`
- Curly Brackets : `{}`

## Approach & Efficiency

- Big O - O(n) for traversing through the string input
